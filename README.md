# Abstract:

Elevated temperatures and extended drought periods are driving significant changes in the structure and function of forest ecosystems. High-elevation alpine ash forests (_Eucalyptus delegatensis_ R.T. Baker) in Australia are an example of forests that are already impacted by climate change. These obligate seeder forests can shift to non-forest eco-systems following extreme drought and altered fire regimes, raising concern about their adaptation to a rapidly changing environment and long-term forest persistence. Plant functional traits play a major role in determining adaptive mechanisms to environmental conditions. While alpine ash forests are vulnerable to climate change, it is unclear if different provenances have adapted to the climatic conditions in which they grow. We therefore studied the variation in expression of functional traits related to drought tolerance in 21 provenances of alpine ash distributed across an environmental gradient. We investigated if functional traits varied between the provenances and were related to climate of origin in order to identify provenances that may be better adapted to drought. We measured the following traits in a common garden experiment under well-watered conditions: stomatal density, specific leaf area, minimum stomatal conductance and osmotic potential at full turgor. There was very little variation in trait expression between the 21 provenances for all functional traits related to drought tolerance. All provenances had medium-range stomatal density (170–300 stomata mm^2) and specific leaf area (SLA, 50–70 cm2 g^−1), a very low minimum stomatal conductance (2–4 mmol m2 s^−1) and a high osmotic potential at full turgor (−0.6–0.7 MPa). There was no statistically significant correlation of trait expression with the climate of origin. Thus, there is very little evidence for genetically controlled differences in trait expression of drought tolerance traits in this species. It is likely that the high elevation and high rainfall environment of the species’ ecological niche has not been subjected to frequent and extensive drought periods that would elicit an evolutionary pressure selecting for drought-tolerant traits. We could not identify provenances that would have different drought-tolerant functional trait responses than others, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage under climate change. This has implications for using climate-adjusted provenancing to improve resilience in alpine ash forests predicted to experience more frequent and severe droughts in the future.
